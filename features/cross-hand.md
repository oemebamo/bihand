# 🔑 Cross-Hand Access Shortcuts

Yes, sometimes your left hand needs characters that are only available on the right-hand part of your keyboard. Don't worry: BiHand v1.1 introduces cross-hand access shortcuts!

## 👈 Left Hand Wants Right-Hand Keys?

You must enter the sacred sequence:

```
asd-fga-sdf
```

Once in this “Right Hand Emulation Mode™”, pressing:

- `q` → types `y`
- `a` → types `u`
- `z` → types `p`
- `x` → types `m`

To exit, type:

````
gds-ads-fad
````

## 👉 Right Hand Wants Left-Hand Keys?
Use the mystical sequence:

```
jkl-hjk-lkj
```

Now your right hand can summon:

- `h` → `q`
- `j` → `w`
- `k` → `a`
- `l` → `s`

To exit:

```
klj-hlk-jhk
```

## ⚡ Why So Complicated?

Because true productivity isn’t about being fast, it’s about performing complex rituals that **feel fast** while explaining to everyone else how they’re doing it wrong.
